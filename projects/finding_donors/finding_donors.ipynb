    "Welcome to the second project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "\n",
    "We're trying to classify data into two categories, i.e. our output is a binary 1 or 0. Our inputs have been scaled and one-hot encoded, so we've got 103 features whose values are between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the following three models:\n",
    "- Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "- Ensemble Methods\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naive Bayes**\n",
    "- One real-world industrial application for this model might be anomolous behavior detection in physical systems. Sensors provide readings that are assumed to be gaussian in nature, and the output is the binary presence/absence of anomolous behavior. One example of such a system might be a large mining truck (https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/products/mining-equipment/mining-trucks/mining-trucks.html) whose parts are expensive to replace. If you equip the truck with accelerometers, you could apply a Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm to the sensor readings to determine when the truck has experienced abnormal conditions and should be brought in for maintenance.\n",
    "- The model performs well when the values of the input features are best described as a gaussian probability distribution. This is a good model to apply to problems where you have continuous streams of data, such as sensor applications.\n",
    "- The model performs poorly when the individual features are not independent, i.e. if a function can be applied to one feature to output another feature. Feature interdependence can result in inaccuracy.\n",
    "- I'm not actually convinced that this model is a good candidate for the problem, given that some of the features have been one-hot encoded. Intuitively, it seems like one-hot encoded features are not pureley independent of one another, since a \"1\" value for a feature ensures that the other features are \"0\" value. A \"0\" value for a feature does not ensure a \"1\" value for the other features, but it increases the probability the other features are a \"1\" value. I chose to test and discuss this model because I want to confirm my suspicion that this is not going to perform as well as the other two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Methods**\n",
    "- Ensemble Methods encompass several different ways of developing a model for a single data set. For example, one of these methods, called \"Bagging,\" is the process of applying a model to multiple sub-sets of the training data, either by excluding some features or excluding some data points. This results in multiple predictors, whose predictions are aggregated when applying these multiple models to a test data point. Another example, \"Random Forests,\" builds multiple decision tree models with random sub-sets of the training data. Again, this results in multiple predictors, whose predictions are averaged when applying the decision trees to a test data point. AdaBoost, or “boosting” — the iterative process of applying a weak learner (slightly better than a coin toss) to weighted versions of the training set. In each iteration, the weights of incorrectly predicted data points is increased slightly, so that subsequent iterations focus on the more challenging data points to predict. Industrial examples include rating predictors, such as Netflix's algorithm to predict the out-of-five-stars rating someone might give a film. Ensemble methods were evidently used in winning the \"Netflix Prize\" - http://blog.echen.me/2011/10/24/winning-the-netflix-prize-a-summary/. \n",
    "- Ensemble methods perform well when the data in the training set has mixed type. For example, Bagging allows you to use a model that might perform well on numeric data, and another model that might perform well on categorical data. Since the results of these models will ultimately be aggregated, the right model can be used for the right data type.\n",
    "- Ensemble methods might perform poorly on larger data sets, as it is challenging to scale some of these methods. For example, Boosting is an iterative process and so would be computationally expensive to train on large datasets.\n",
    "- Ensemble methods appear to be a good candidate for this problem because there are multiple data types within the data set, and that's a known strength of some Ensemble Methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines are often used in biology. One reference explains SVM application to cancer diagnosis: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ed91/7e043ac071379de2f5890ef9ca51aa961039.pdf. The authors use different kinds of SVMs to diagnose cancer based on gene expression, and were able to diagnose cancer with high accuracy and with fewer genes than other methods.\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines perform well when there are more features than data points. Because of this, it's a good choice for reinforcement-type applications where, for example, items need to be classified with a small set of images presented to a person. Think: \"like vs. dislike\" on a dating website, SVM models could begin learning a user's preferences faster than other models.\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines do not perform so well when you need to know the probability estimate of the test data point as well as its classification. Since the SVM model works by determining which side of a boundary the test point falls on, an extra step must be taken to calculate an actual probability of group membership. This extra step is a computationally expensive cross-validation.\n",
    "- This model is a decent candidate for the problem because we're hoping to classify without necessarily assigning a probability, and we have a decently large feature space to grapple with. I'm curious to see how it will perform against the other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, I expect these three models to perform in this order, from best to worst:\n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",

    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
